# Skeleton: 

This library provides extraction for iOS, Android and Windows packages.

## Usage 

add to packages
```
@skeleton/skeleton-extract-package": "~0.0.1"
```

import
```
import { Extract } from '@skeleton/skeleton-extract-package';
```

usage
```
let results = await Extract.run(pathName);
```
## Results 

depending on which type of app you extract, you'll recieve slightly different return objects. 
Parenthesis give some context to what the fields mean, and the rest is the location that the info is pulled from

IPA
```
icon and iconName speak for themselves
languages = array of language strings compiled from .lproj files
hasProvisioning = should always be true since IPA will contain a provisioning profile
appex_provisioning_profiles = array of all other provisioning profiles included in the metadata
```
- from Plist (info.plist):
```
displayName =  CFBundleDisplayName (The user-visible name of the bundle) || CFBundleName (short bundle name)
uniqueIdentifier =  CFBundleIdentifier (reverse DNS that identifies a project by concatenating the company identifier with the product name)
version =  CFBundleShortVersionString (The release-version-number string for the bundle)
buildVersion = CFBundleVersion (The build-version-number string for the bundle)
executableName =  CFBundleExecutable (Name of the bundleâ€™s executable file)
minimumOsVersion =  MinimumOSVersion || LSMinimumSystemVersion
deviceFamily = UIdeviceFamily;
```
- from Provisioning Profile (embedded.mobileprovision):
```
pathName = path of the provisioning profile from inside of the IPA
mobileProvisionFileContent = provisioning profile content
teamIdentifier = Entitlements["com.apple.developer.team-identifier"] (team ID number for recognizing who build || who can work on this app)
profileType = if data.ProvisionedDevices exists, "adhoc". Otherwise "enterprise"
expiredAt = expired_at || ExpirationDate 
idName = AppIDName 
name = Name
UniqueDeviceIdentifierList = ProvisionedDevices 
deviceFamily = Platform
```

APK
- from Manifest:
```
iconName, icon - requires searching through a ton of different folders, no good way afaik
uniqueIdentifier =  package
version =  versionName
buildVersion =  versionCode
minimumOsVersion =  usesSdk.minSdkVersion
deviceFamily = "android"
```

APPX - either uploaded with .appx, appxupload or .zip extension
- from Manifest:
```
this.deviceFamily = Constants.WINDOWS
displayName = Package.Properties.DisplayName
iconFullPath = Package.Properties.Logo
uniqueIdentifier  =  Package.Identity.Name 
buildVersion = Package.Identity.Version
minimumOsVersion = Package.Prerequisites.OSMinVersion || Package.Dependencies.TargetDeviceFamily.MinVersion
executableName =  Package.Applications.Application.Executable 
languages = built from - Package.Resources.Resource.Language
```


APPXBundle - either uploaded with .appxbundle, appxupload or .zip extension
for .appxbundle app packages, the manifest is checked for the correct name of the appx subpackage.
	if it is found, the metadata is parsed directly from there, otherwise you scavenge for as much as you can get from the appxbundle manifest and metadata
```
iconAppx = the name of the zipped file within the package that contains icons
icon and iconName speak for themselves
languages = built from .appx language files. Example- VLC_WinRT.WindowsPhone_1.8.4.0_language-en.appx
```
- from Manifest:
```
deviceFamily = "windows"
uniqueIdentifier =  Bundle.Identity.Name
buildVersion =  Bundle.Identity.Version
minimumOsVersion = Bundle.Prerequisites.OSMinVersion || Bundle.Dependencies.TargetDeviceFamily
```

The assumption for zip and appxUpload is that the unziped folders will have the appx or appxbundle which we will then process as we do normally

## Prerequisites ##

- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/) version [5.11.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/x64/)

- Install poject dependencies (based on `<REPO ROOT>/package.json`)
	```
    npm install
	```
- Install [typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (`npm` will be installed with `node`)
	```
	npm install -g typescript@2.3.4
	```
- Install [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)
	```
	npm install -g gulp@3.9
	```
- Upgrade [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to version `3.3.x`
	```
	npm install -g npm@3.3
	```
- Install the IDE
	- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	
## Contributing ##

- If it's
	- Larger than a bug fix - create a feature branch (`feature/<SOME NAME>`) and work on this branch. While on your feature branch you are free to use self-defined rules. When your feature is complete (coded _and_ tested) create a pull request for `develop`.
	
	- A bug fix - fix it on `develop`
	
	- Smaller than a bug fix - nope

- Ensure that it builds
	- Via `gulp`
		```
		cd <REPO ROOT>
		gulp build
		```	
- Ensure that tests pass
	- Via `gulp`
		```
		cd <REPO ROOT>
		gulp test
		```	
- Pull requests to `develop` are required but require no aproval to merge. Use best judgement.

## Developing on OS X ##

- Visual Studio Code

	- Point `Visual Studio Code` to the repo root
	- Install project dependencies 
		- via `npm` on the command line
			```
			cd <REPO ROOT>
			npm install 
			```
	- Build (`Cmd-Shift-B`)
	- Run (`F5`)
	- Testing
		- via `Visual Studio Code` (`Cmd-Shift-T`)
		- via `gulp` on the command line
			```
			cd <REPO ROOT>
			gulp test
			```
